### Hi, stranger(or, aren't you *vsauce theme starts playing*)
I am DevHONK, HatKid, Goose, *sigh* I have so many usernames..., and I am a *kinda* C, C++, JS, assembly, and mostly a Java and Miam(yeah the programming language I created) dev.
Always wanting to explore stuff ranging from a console piano to OSes(*HonkOS intensifies*)!
Also, I am on Arkode(go check this server) and Ordinal Team(go check if weeb, dev and French)
So... If you want to contact me, I am on Discord(mostly on Arkode, but you can DM me (4061#4061))
(btw I hope you have a good day, and stay with a mask 😷 to protect your friends!)
